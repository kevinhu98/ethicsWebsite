        <h2>
            <i> You select <tt> Susan</tt>. </i><br>
            Immediately, a younger child around the age of 9 walks into the room.<br>
            You recognize this child. <br>
            You had been advising her previously due to her Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) <br><br>
            
            "Hey Susan. What can I do for you today?" <br><br>
            
            "Hi {{firstName}}. It's not going too well." <br>
            "The app said that I should see you about my grades" <br>
            "Sure thing, just give me a second to pull it up" <br><br>
            
            Although you have many criticisms of the app, one thing that always stood out to you was the clarity of the user interface. <br>
            You enter Susan's full name into the database. <br><br>
            
            As soon as you hit enter, the screen prints in bright red letters: <br>
            <font color="red">Warning: Student has a 99.4% chance of failing this semester </font> <br><br>

            Immediately, thoughts begin rushing to your head. <br><br>
            <i>Could this algorithm be incorrect? <br><br>
            You had expected Susan to not be performing very well due to her condition, but by this much? <br><br>
            How is the algorithm calculating such a number? The actual number is suspiciously precise. <br><br>
                We are only 3 months into the semester, how far can it actually predict ahead? <br><br> </i>

            And most importantly, how would Susan react if I told her this information? <br>
            She already has a learning disability. <br>
            Something like this would crush her morale. <br><br>

            However, you are an advisor, it is your duty to tell students the truth. What kind of advisor would lie to a student about their grades? <br><br>
